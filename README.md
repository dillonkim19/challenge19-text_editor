DESCRIPTION
-----------
This web application is a text editor that runs in the browser and is a single-page application. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.

This app gets and stores data to an IndexedDB database. A package called `idb` is used; `idb` is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.
